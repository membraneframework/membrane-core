  Callback that defines what source pads may be ever available for this
  element type.

  It should return a map where:

  * key contains pad name. That may be either atom (like `:source`,
    `:something_else` for pads that are always available, or string for pads
    that are added dynamically),
  * value is a tuple where:
    * first item of the tuple contains pad availability. It may be set only
      `:always` at the moment,
    * second item of the tuple contains pad mode (`:pull` or `:push`),
    * third item of the tuple contains `:any` or list of caps that can be
      knownly generated from this pad.

  The default name for generic source pad, in elements that just produce some
  buffers is `:source`.

  @doc """
  Callback that is called when buffer should be emitted by the source or filter.

  It will be called only for pads in the pull mode, as in their case demand
  is triggered by the sinks.

  For pads in the push mode, Elemen should generate buffers without this
  callback. Example scenario might be reading a stream over TCP, waiting
  for incoming packets that will be delivered to the PID of the element,
  which will result in calling `handle_other/2`, which can return value that
  contains the `:buffer` action.

  It is safe to use blocking reads in the filter. It will cause limiting
  throughput of the pipeline to the capability of the source.

  The arguments are:

  * name of the pad receiving a demand request,
  * requested number of units
  * unit
  * context (`Membrane.Element.Context.Demand`)
  * current element's state.
