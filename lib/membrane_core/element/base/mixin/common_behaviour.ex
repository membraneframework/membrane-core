  Callback invoked when element is initialized, right after new process is
  spawned. It will receive options passed to `Membrane.Element.start_link/3`
  or `Membrane.Element.start/3`.

  On success it should return `{:ok, initial_element_state}`. Then given state
  becomes first element's state.

  On failure it should return `{:error, reason}`.

  Returning error will terminate the process without calling `handle_shutdown/1`
  callback.

  Callback invoked when element is prepared. It will receive element state.

  Normally this is the place where you will allocate most of the resources
  used by the element. For example, if your element opens a file, this is
  the place to try to actually open it and return error if that has failed.

  Such resources should be released in `handle_stop/1`.

  If it returns `{:ok, new_state}` it just updates element's state to the new
  state.

  If it returns `{:ok, command_list, new_state}` it sends buffers or/and events
  from the given list downstream to the linked elements. That makes sense
  only for elements that have some source pads. If command in the list is
  `{:send, pad_name, [buffers_or_events]}` it will cause sending given buffers
  and/or events downstream to the linked elements via pad of given name.
  Afterwards the element's state will be updated to the new state.

  If it returns `{:error, reason, new_state}` it indicates that something
  went wrong, and element was unable to handle callback. Error along with
  reason will be propagated to the message bus and state will be updated to
  the new state.

  Callback invoked when element is shutting down just before process is exiting.

  Return value is ignored.

  If shutdown will be invoked without stopping element first, warning will be
  issued and this is considered to be a programmer's mistake. That implicates
  that most of the resources should be normally released in `handle_stop/1`.

  However, you might want to do some additional cleanup when process is exiting,
