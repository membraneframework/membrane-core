defmodule Membrane.Element.Manager.Source do
  @moduledoc """
  Base module to be used by all elements that are sources, in other words,
  elements that produce the buffers. Some examples might be: a file reader,
  a sound card input.

  ## Callbacks

  As for all base elements in the Membrane Framework, lifecycle of sinks is
  defined by set of callbacks. All of them have names with the `handle_` prefix.
  They are used to define reaction to certain events that happen during runtime,
  and indicate what actions frawork should undertake as a result, besides
  executing element-specific code.

  ## Actions

  All callbacks have to return a value.

  If they were successful they return `{:ok, actions, new_state}` tuple,
  where `actions` is a list of actions to be undertaken by the framework after
  the callback has finished its execution.

  Each action may be one of the following:

  * `{:buffer, {pad_name, buffer}}` - it will cause sending given buffer
    from pad of given name to its peer.
  * `{:caps, {pad_name, caps}}` - it will cause sending new caps for pad of
    given name.
  * `{:event, {pad_name, event}}` - it will cause sending given event
    from pad of given name to its peer.
  * `{:message, message}` - it will cause sending given message to the element's
    message bus (usually a pipeline) if any is defined,

  ## Demand

  If Element.Manager has source pads in the pull mode, the demand will be triggered
  by sinks. The `handle_demand/2` callback will be then invoked but
  should not return more than one buffer per one `handle_demand/2` call.
  In such case, if Element.Manager is holding more data than for one buffer,
  the remaining data should remain cached in the element's state and released
  upon next `handle_demand/2`.

  If Element.Manager has source pads in the push mode, it is allowed to generate
  buffers at any time.

  ## Example

  The simplest possible source Element.Manager that has pad working in the pull mode,
  looks like the following:

      defmodule Membrane.Element.Manager.Sample.Source do
        use Membrane.Element.Manager.Base.Source

        def_known_source_pads %{
          :source => {:always, :pull, :any}
        }

        # Private API

        @doc false
        def handle_demand(_pad, state) do
          # Produce one buffer in response to demand
          {:ok, [
            {:buffer, {:source, %Membrane.Buffer{payload: "test"}}}
          ], state}
        end
      end
